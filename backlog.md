# UX Improvement Backlog
<!-- Status: [ ] todo · [~] in-progress · [x] done · [!] failed -->
<!-- Goal: anything that makes this the best plugin — from atomic fixes to full overhauls. No users yet, no backwards compat needed. -->
<!-- Completed items: see scripts/backlog/progress.txt -->
<!-- Organization: by functional area, not by screen — resilient to UI restructuring -->
<!-- Inbox: backlog-inbox.md — drained into this file by backlog.sh each iteration -->

- [!] ExportPanel live preview re-runs all format generators on every settings change without debounce — changing a single toggle (e.g., "include descriptions") synchronously rebuilds the full ZIP and all preview strings; for large token sets this causes visible jank; debounce the preview rebuild by 250ms, matching the pattern already used in search inputs across the app (ExportPanel.tsx ~L500-1000)
- [!] ResolverPanel is undiscoverable — it only appears inside ThemeManager behind an "Advanced" toggle; users who create themes and later want to configure DTCG resolvers have no indication this panel exists from any navigation path; either surface Resolvers as a dedicated sub-tab under Define (alongside Themes, Generators) or add a visible "Resolvers" link in the ThemeManager header that doesn't require toggling Advanced mode first (ResolverPanel.tsx, App.tsx tab structure)

- [!] No "Select all in group" action on group context menu — in multi-select mode, selecting all tokens in a group requires clicking each one individually; the group context menu should offer "Select children" to select all leaf tokens under the group in one click, matching standard tree-view selection behavior (TokenTreeNode.tsx group context menu ~L626-793)

- [~] ThemeManager dimension list has no search/filter UI despite the state existing — dimSearch state and a ref are declared in ThemeManager.tsx (~L138-139) but the search input is never rendered; users with many theme dimensions cannot filter by name or coverage status; implement the search input using the existing state and add a "show only dimensions with gaps" toggle

- [~] Theme comparison panel is buried and hard to discover — the side-by-side token diff across theme options is a powerful feature but is only accessible by toggling a compare mode inside ThemeManager; surface it as a prominent action (e.g., "Compare options" button on each dimension row) or make it accessible from the command palette
- [~] No token value history per token — the History panel shows operation-level history (bulk changes, generator runs) but there's no way to see the history of a single token's value over time; power users managing brand colors or key spacing values need to see "this token was #1a73e8, then changed to #1967d2 on March 15"; add a "Value history" section to TokenDetailPreview or the token editor that queries the operation log filtered by token path
- [ ] AnalyticsPanel duplicate detection and lint's no-duplicate-values rule overlap — AnalyticsPanel has its own duplicate value detection section while the lint system has a `no-duplicate-values` rule; users see duplicates in two different places with potentially different results; consolidate by having AnalyticsPanel read from lint results rather than running its own scan, or remove the analytics duplicate section and link to the lint violations view
